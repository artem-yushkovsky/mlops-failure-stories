    * involved: fluent-bit, missing logs, Fluentd
    * impact: lost application logs in production

# Why

Kubernetes is a fairly complex system with many moving parts.
Its ecosystem is constantly evolving and adding even more layers (service mesh, ...) to the mix.
Considering this environment, we don't hear enough real-world horror stories to learn from each other!
This compilation of failure stories should make it easier for people dealing with Kubernetes operations (SRE, Ops, platform/infrastructure teams) to
learn from others and reduce the unknown unknowns of running Kubernetes in production.
For more information, [see the blog post](https://srcco.de/posts/mlops-failure-stories.html).
